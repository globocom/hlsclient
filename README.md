hls-client
==========

This is a simple Python [HTTP Live Streaming Client](https://developer.apple.com/resources/http-streaming/). It consumes a list of remote
playlists, and saves all needed files to serve the playlist
locally: the key, segments, and a modified `m3u8` with
paths normalized.

It also supports backups, i.e., if the same playlist is available
on more than one server, it will track each server status and will
switch to the backup if needed.

Through the `config.ini` it's possible to customize where the files
will be saved and what is the URL that provides servers info via JSON.

The JSON must be something like:

    {
        actives: [
            {
                m3u8: "/msfc/Edge.m3u8",
                servers: [
                "liveips.nasa.gov.edgesuite.net"
                ],
                bitrates: [],
                needs_index: false
            }
        ]
    }
